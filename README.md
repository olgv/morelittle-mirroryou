### Mirror You

Part of the `More with Little` challenge series, this project aims to generate interactive content using as little code and as basic web technologies as possible.

A project capturing the camera feed and generate an ASCII rendition using VGA437 as a font. All computed in 73 deployed lines packaged in one file. The font file is the only external dependency.  

```
!!! Requires web camera access.  
!!! No data of the video camera is captured, saved, sent anywhere. 
    Everything is processed on your computer, by the browser.
```
<br />

**How to:**  
Click on the ASCII to copy the text content to your clipboard, and paste later on wherever you want.  
You can even use it as a password.
